title: "What is Abstract?"
description: "A high-level overview of what Abstract is and how it works."
---

Abstract is a [Layer 2](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/) (L2) network built on top of
[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/), designed to securely power consumer-facing
blockchain applications at scale with low fees and fast transaction speeds.

Built on top of the [ZK Stack](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack), Abstract is a
[zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/) built to
be a more scalable alternative to Ethereum; it achieves this scalability by executing transactions off-chain, batching them together,
and verifying batches of transactions on Ethereum using [(ZK) proofs](https://ethereum.org/en/zero-knowledge-proofs/).

Abstract is [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) compatible, meaning it looks and feels like
Ethereum, but with lower gas fees and higher transaction throughput. Most existing smart contracts built for Ethereum will work
out of the box on Abstract ([with some differences](/how-abstract-works/evm-differences/overview)),
meaning developers can easily port applications to Abstract with minimal changes.
