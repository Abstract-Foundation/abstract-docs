title: "useWriteContractSponsored"
description: "Hook for interacting with smart contracts using paymasters to cover gas fees."
---

Use the `useWriteContractSponsored` hook to initiate transactions on smart contracts with the transaction gas fees sponsored by a
[paymaster](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/paymasters).

It uses the [useWriteContract](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWriteContract) hook from [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/)
under the hood.

## Import

```tsx
import { useWriteContractSponsored } from "@abstract-foundation/agw-react";
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { useWriteContractSponsored } from "@abstract-foundation/agw-react";
import { getGeneralPaymasterInput } from "viem/zksync";
import type { Abi } from "viem";

const contractAbi: Abi = [
  /* Your contract ABI here */
];

export default function App() {
  const { writeContractSponsored, data, error, isSuccess, isPending } =
    useWriteContractSponsored();

  const handleWriteContract = () => {
    writeContractSponsored({
      abi: contractAbi,
      address: "0xC4822AbB9F05646A9Ce44EFa6dDcda0Bf45595AA",
      functionName: "mint",
      args: [address, BigInt(1)],
      paymaster: "0x5407B5040dec3D339A9247f3654E59EEccbb6391",
      paymasterInput: getGeneralPaymasterInput({
        innerInput: "0x",
      }),
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleWriteContract} disabled={isPending}>
        {isPending ? "Processing..." : "Execute Sponsored Transaction"}
      </button>
      {isSuccess && <div>Transaction Hash: {data}</div>}
      {error && <div>Error: {error.message}</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```
