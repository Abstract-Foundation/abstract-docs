description: Hook to get the approved signer of the connected Abstract Global Wallet.
---

Use the `useGlobalWalletSignerAccount` hook to retrieve the [account](https://viem.sh/docs/ethers-migration#signers--accounts)
approved to sign transactions for the connected Abstract Global Wallet. This is helpful if you need to access the underlying [EOA](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account)
approved to sign transactions for the Abstract Global Wallet smart contract.

It uses the [useAccount](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useAccount) hook from [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) under the hood.

## Import

```tsx
import { useGlobalWalletSignerAccount } from "@abstract-foundation/agw-react";
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { useGlobalWalletSignerAccount } from "@abstract-foundation/agw-react";

export default function App() {
  const { address, status } = useGlobalWalletSignerAccount();

  if (status === "disconnected") return <div>Disconnected</div>;

  if (status === "connecting" || status === "reconnecting") {
    return <div>Connecting...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      Connected to EOA: {address}
      Status: {status}
    </div>
  );
}
```
