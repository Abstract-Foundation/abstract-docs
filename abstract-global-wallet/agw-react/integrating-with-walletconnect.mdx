## Installation

Follow the [Reown quickstart](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/overview#quickstart) for your preferred framework to install the necessary dependencies and initialize AppKit.

Configure `abstract` or `abstractTestnet` as the chain in your AppKit configuration.

```ts
import { abstract } from "@reown/appkit/networks";
```
