The `agw-react` package provides a set of hooks and components that allow users to sign in and send
transactions using Abstract Global Wallet. **It is built on top of the [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) library.**

Once the user connect&rsquo;s their wallet by calling [useLoginWithAbstract](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-react/useLoginWithAbstract) _(within the context
of an [AbstractWalletProvider](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-react/AbstractWalletProvider)_),
you can continue to use any of the [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) and [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview)
hooks as you would with any other wallet, as well as all of the [viem](https://viem.sh/) functionality.

## How it works

Both wagmi and TanStack Query wrap your application in a **provider** component that allows you
to use the hooks and components they provide anywhere in your application.
This is called the [provider pattern](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context).

The `agw-react` package similarly provides the [AbstractWalletProvider](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-react/AbstractWalletProvider) component,
which under the hood wraps your application in both of these providers:

- The TanStack [QueryClientProvider](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/reference/QueryClientProvider):
  to manage your application's state using [queries](https://wagmi.sh/react/guides/tanstack-query) and [mutations](https://wagmi.sh/react/guides/tanstack-query),
  e.g. to check if a wallet is connected, read data from the blockchain, and send transactions.
- The wagmi [WagmiProvider](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/WagmiProvider): configured to use the Abstract [networks](/connect-to-abstract)
  and the Abstract Global Wallet as a [wallet connection option](https://wagmi.sh/react/guides/connect-wallet).
