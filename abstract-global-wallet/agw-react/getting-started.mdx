## Native Integration

Alternatively, integrate AGW into an existing React application using the steps below, or [<Icon icon="youtube" iconType="solid" /> watch the video tutorial](https://youtu.be/P5lvuBcmisU) for a step-by-step walkthrough.

### 1. Install agw-react

To install the `agw-react package`, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @abstract-foundation/agw-react wagmi viem@2.x @tanstack/react-query
```

### 2. Setup the AbstractWalletProvider

Wrap your application in the `AbstractWalletProvider` component to enable the use of the package's hooks and components
throughout your application.

```tsx
import { AbstractWalletProvider } from "@abstract-foundation/agw-react";

const config = {
  testnet: true, // Required
  // Optionally, provide your own RPC URL (learn more: https://viem.sh/docs/clients/transports/http.html)
  // transport: http("https://your.abstract.node.example.com/rpc") // Optional
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <AbstractWalletProvider config={config}>
      {/* Your application components */}
    </AbstractWalletProvider>
  );
};
```

<Tip>
  **Next.js App Router:** If you are using [Next.js App
  Router](https://nextjs.org/docs), create a new component and add the `use
  client` directive at the top of your file ([see
  example](https://github.com/Abstract-Foundation/examples/blob/main/agw-nextjs/src/components/NextAbstractWalletProvider.tsx))
  and wrap your application in this component ([see
  example](https://github.com/Abstract-Foundation/examples/blob/main/agw-nextjs/src/app/layout.tsx#L48-L54)).
</Tip>

The `AbstractWalletProvider` wraps your application in both the [WagmiProvider](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/WagmiProvider) and
[QueryClientProvider](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/reference/QueryClientProvider),
meaning you can use the hooks and features of these libraries within your application.

### 3. Use React Hooks

With the provider setup, you can now use any of the available [hooks](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-react/hooks/useAbstractClient)
from the `agw-react` package inside
any component within your application. To prompt the user to sign in with AGW, use the
[useLoginWithAbstract](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-react/hooks/useLoginWithAbstract) hook.

```tsx
import { useLoginWithAbstract } from "@abstract-foundation/agw-react";

export default function SignIn() {
  // login function to prompt the user to sign in with AGW.
  const { login } = useLoginWithAbstract();

  return <button onClick={login}>Connect with AGW</button>;
}
```

### 4. Use wagmi hooks

Once the user has signed in, you can begin to use any of the `agw-react` hooks,
such as [useWriteContractSponsored](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-react/hooks/useWriteContractSponsored)
as well as all of the existing [wagmi hooks](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks); such as [useAccount](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useAccount),
[useBalance](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useBalance), etc.

All transactions will be sent from the connected AGW smart contract wallet (i.e. the `tx.from` address will be the AGW smart contract wallet address).

```tsx
import { useAccount, useSendTransaction } from "wagmi";

export default function SendTransactionWithWagmi() {
  const { address, status } = useAccount();
  const { sendTransaction, isPending } = useSendTransaction();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        sendTransaction({
          to: "0x273B3527BF5b607dE86F504fED49e1582dD2a1C6",
          data: "0x69",
        })
      }
      disabled={isPending || status !== "connected"}
    >
      {isPending ? "Sending..." : "Send Transaction"}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### 5. Use the client directly

The [AbstractClient](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/createAbstractClient)
also exposes a set of [actions](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/actions/deployContract)
you can use to interact with the wallet, including
[deploying a contract](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/actions/deployContract),
[sending a transaction](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/actions/sendTransaction),
or [calling a contract function](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/actions/writeContract).

```tsx
import { useGlobalWalletSignerClient } from "@abstract-foundation/agw-react";

export default function SendTransaction() {
  const { data: client } = useGlobalWalletSignerClient();

  async function submitTransaction() {
    const hash = await client.sendTransaction({
      to: "0x273B3527BF5b607dE86F504fED49e1582dD2a1C6",
      data: "0x69",
    });
  }

  return <button onClick={submitTransaction}>Submit Transaction</button>;
}
```
