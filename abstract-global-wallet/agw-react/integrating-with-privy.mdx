---

[Privy](https://docs.privy.io/guide/react/quickstart) powers the login screen and EOA creation
of Abstract Global Wallet, meaning you can use Privy&rsquo;s features and SDKs natively alongside AGW.

The `agw-react` package includes a `AbstractPrivyProvider` component that allows you to
use Privy features from the Abstract Global Wallet (e.g. sending transactions).

This page assumes you have already created an app on the [Privy dashboard](https://docs.privy.io/guide/react/quickstart).

## 1. Enable Abstract Integration

From the [Privy dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io/),
navigate to **Ecosystem** > **Integrations**.

Scroll down to find **Abstract** and toggle the switch to enable the integration.

## 2. Setup the AbstractPrivyProvider


Wrap your application in the `AbstractPrivyProvider` component, providing your
<Tooltip tip="Available from the Settings tab of the Privy dashboard.">Privy app ID</Tooltip>
 as the `appId` prop.

```tsx
import { AbstractPrivyProvider } from "@abstract-foundation/agw-react/privy";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <AbstractPrivyProvider appId="your-privy-app-id">
      {children}
    </AbstractPrivyProvider>
  );
};
```

## 3. Login users

Use the `useAbstractPrivyLogin` hook to prompt users to login with Abstract Global Wallet.

```tsx
import { useAbstractPrivyLogin } from "@abstract-foundation/agw-react/privy";

const LoginButton = () => {
  const { login, link } = useAbstractPrivyLogin();
  return <button onClick={login}>Login with Abstract</button>;
};
```

- The `login` function uses Privy's [loginWithCrossAppAccount](https://docs.privy.io/guide/react/cross-app/requester#login)
function to authenticate users with their Abstract Global Wallet account. 

- The `link` function uses Privy's [linkCrossAppAccount](https://docs.privy.io/guide/react/cross-app/requester#linking) 
function to allow authenticated users to link their existing account to an Abstract Global Wallet.

## 4. Use hooks and functions

Once the user has signed in, you can begin to use any of the `agw-react` hooks,
such as [useWriteContractSponsored](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-react/hooks/useWriteContractSponsored)
as well as all of the existing [wagmi hooks](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks); such as [useAccount](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useAccount),
[useBalance](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useBalance), etc.

All transactions will be sent from the connected AGW smart contract wallet (i.e. the `tx.from` address will be the AGW smart contract wallet address).

```tsx
import { useAccount, useSendTransaction } from "wagmi";

export default function Example() {
  const { address, status } = useAccount();
  const { sendTransaction, isPending } = useSendTransaction();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        sendTransaction({
          to: "0x273B3527BF5b607dE86F504fED49e1582dD2a1C6",
          data: "0x69",
        })
      }
      disabled={isPending || status !== "connected"}
    >
      {isPending ? "Sending..." : "Send Transaction"}
    </button>
  );
}
```
