description: "Function to deterministically derive the deployed Abstract Global Wallet smart account address from the initial signer account."
---

Use the `getSmartAccountAddressFromInitialSigner` function to get the address of the Abstract Global Wallet smart account
that will be deployed for a given initial signer account.

This is useful if you need to know what the address will be for the deployed Abstract Global Wallet smart contract will be
before it is deployed.

## Import

```tsx
import { getSmartAccountAddressFromInitialSigner } from "@abstract-foundation/agw-client";
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { getSmartAccountAddressFromInitialSigner } from "@abstract-foundation/agw-client";
import { createPublicClient, http } from "viem";
import { abstractTestnet } from "viem/chains";

// Create a public client connected to the desired chain
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: abstractTestnet,
  transport: http(),
});

// Initial signer address (EOA)
const initialSignerAddress = "0xYourSignerAddress";

// Get the smart account address
const smartAccountAddress = await getSmartAccountAddressFromInitialSigner(
  initialSignerAddress,
  publicClient
);

console.log("Smart Account Address:", smartAccountAddress);
```

## Parameters

<ResponseField name="initialSigner" type="Address" required>
  The EOA account/signer that will be the owner of the AGW smart contract
  wallet.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="publicClient" type="PublicClient" required>
  A [public client](https://viem.sh/zksync/client) connected to the desired
  chain (e.g. `abstractTestnet`).
</ResponseField>

## Returns

Returns an `0x${string}`: The address of the AGW smart contract that will be deployed.

## How it works

The smart account address is derived from the initial signer using the following process:

```tsx
import AccountFactoryAbi from "./abis/AccountFactory.js"; // ABI of AGW factory contract
import { keccak256, toBytes } from "viem";
import { SMART_ACCOUNT_FACTORY_ADDRESS } from "./constants.js";

// Generate salt based off address
const addressBytes = toBytes(initialSigner);
const salt = keccak256(addressBytes);

// Get the deployed account address
const accountAddress = (await publicClient.readContract({
  address: SMART_ACCOUNT_FACTORY_ADDRESS, // "0xe86Bf72715dF28a0b7c3C8F596E7fE05a22A139c"
  abi: AccountFactoryAbi,
  functionName: "getAddressForSalt",
  args: [salt],
})) as Hex;
```

This function returns the determined AGW smart contract address
using the [Contract Deployer](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#contractdeployer)&rsquo;s
`getNewAddressForCreate2` function.
