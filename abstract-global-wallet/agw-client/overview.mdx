The `agw-client` package exposes an [AbstractClient](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/createAbstractClient),
built on top of the [Viem Wallet Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html)
that allows you to deploy contracts, submit transactions, and more from the Abstract Global Wallet.

All of the features of [Viem](https://viem.sh/) are available to you when using the `agw-client` package,
in addition to many specific features for interacting with the Abstract Global Wallet directly.

Learn more about Viem on the official documentation:
