title: "deployContract"
description: Function to deploy a smart contract from the connected Abstract Global Wallet.
---

The [AbstractClient](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/createAbstractClient)
includes a `deployContract` method that can be used to deploy a smart contract from the connected Abstract Global Wallet.
It extends the [deployContract](https://viem.sh/zksync/actions/deployContract) function from Viem to include options for
[contract deployment on Abstract](/how-abstract-works/evm-differences/contract-deployment).

## Usage

<CodeGroup>

```tsx example.ts
import { deployContract } from "@abstract-foundation/agw-client";
import { contractAbi, contractBytecode } from "./const";
import { agwClient } from "./config";
import { abstractTestnet } from "viem/chains";

const hash = await deployContract({
  abi: contractAbi,
  bytecode: contractBytecode,
  chain: abstractTestnet,
  account: agwClient.account,
});
```

```tsx const.ts
export const contractAbi = []; // Your contract ABI
export const contractBytecode = ""; // Your contract bytecode
```

```tsx config.ts
import { createAbstractClient } from "@abstract-foundation/agw-client";
import { generatePrivateKey, privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { abstractTestnet } from "viem/chains";

// As an example, we are creating a new dummy account here for the signer.
const randomPrivateKey = generatePrivateKey(); // Make a random private key
const account = privateKeyToAccount(randomPrivateKey); // Use that to create a signer

export const agwClient = await createAbstractClient({
  chain: abstractTestnet,
  signer: account, // The "owner" (initial approved signer) of the AGW smart contract wallet.
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Parameters

<ResponseField name="abi" type="Abi" required>
  The ABI of the contract to deploy.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="bytecode" type="string" required>
  The bytecode of the contract to deploy.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="account" type="Account" required>
  The account to deploy the contract from. Use the `account` from the
  [AbstractClient](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/createAbstractClient) to
  use the Abstract Global Wallet.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="chain" type="Chain" required>
  The chain to deploy the contract on. e.g. `abstractTestnet`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="args" type="Inferred from ABI">
  Constructor arguments to call upon deployment.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField
  name="deploymentType"
  type="'create' | 'create2' | 'createAccount' | 'create2Account'"
>

Specifies the type of contract deployment. Defaults to `create`.

- `'create'`: Deploys the contract using the `CREATE` opcode.
- `'create2'`: Deploys the contract using the `CREATE2` opcode.
- `'createAccount'`: Deploys a [smart contract wallet](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/smart-contract-wallets)
  using the [ContractDeployer](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#contractdeployer)&rsquo;s
  `createAccount` function.
- `'create2Account'`: Deploys a [smart contract wallet](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/smart-contract-wallets)
  using the [ContractDeployer](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#contractdeployer)&rsquo;s
  `create2Account` function.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="factoryDeps" type="Hex[]">
  An array of bytecodes of contracts that are dependencies for the contract
  being deployed. This is used for deploying contracts that depend on other
  contracts that are not yet deployed on the network. Learn more on the
  [Contract deployment
  page](/how-abstract-works/evm-differences/contract-deployment).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="salt" type="Hash">
  Specifies a unique identifier for the contract deployment.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="gasPerPubdata" type="bigint">
  The amount of gas for publishing one byte of data on Ethereum.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="paymaster" type="Account | Address">
  Address of the paymaster account that will pay the fees. The paymasterInput
  field is required with this one.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="paymasterInput" type="0x${string}">
  Input data to the paymaster. The paymaster field is required with this one.
</ResponseField>

## Returns

Returns the `0x${string}` hash of the transaction that deployed the contract.

Use [waitForTransactionReceipt](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/public/waitForTransactionReceipt) to get the transaction receipt from the hash.
