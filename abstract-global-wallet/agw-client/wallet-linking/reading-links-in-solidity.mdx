The [ExclusiveDelegateResolver](https://sepolia.abscan.org/address/0x0000000078CC4Cc1C14E27c0fa35ED6E5E58825D#code#F1#L19) contract 
provides functions to read wallet links in your Solidity smart contracts. This allows you to build features like:

- Checking if a user has linked their AGW before allowing them to mint an NFT
- Allowing users to claim tokens based on NFTs they own in their Ethereum Mainnet wallet


## Reading Links

First, define the rights identifier used for AGW links:

```solidity
bytes24 constant _AGW_LINK_RIGHTS = bytes24(keccak256("AGW_LINK"));

IExclusiveDelegateResolver public constant DELEGATE_RESOLVER =
    IExclusiveDelegateResolver(0x0000000078CC4Cc1C14E27c0fa35ED6E5E58825D);
```

Then use one of the following functions to read link information:

### Check if an AGW is linked to an EOA

Use `exclusiveWalletByRights` to check if an AGW has an EOA linked:

```solidity
function checkLinkedEOA(address agw) public view returns (address) {
    // Returns either:
    // - If AGW has an EOA linked: the EOA address
    // - If AGW does not have an EOA linked: the AGW address
    return DELEGATE_RESOLVER.exclusiveWalletByRights(agw, _AGW_LINK_RIGHTS);
}
```

### Check what AGWs are linked to an EOA 

Use `delegatedWalletsByRights` to get all AGWs linked to an EOA:

```solidity
function getLinkedAGWs(address eoa) public view returns (address[] memory) {
    // Returns an array of AGW addresses that the EOA has linked to
    return DELEGATE_RESOLVER.delegatedWalletsByRights(eoa, _AGW_LINK_RIGHTS);
}
```

### Check NFT owner's linked AGW

Use `exclusiveOwnerByRights` to check if an NFT owner has linked an AGW:

```solidity
function checkNFTOwnerAGW(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId) public view returns (address) {
    // Returns either:
    // - If NFT owner has linked an AGW: the AGW address
    // - If NFT owner has not linked an AGW: the NFT owner address
    return DELEGATE_RESOLVER.exclusiveOwnerByRights(nftContract, tokenId, _AGW_LINK_RIGHTS);
}
```
