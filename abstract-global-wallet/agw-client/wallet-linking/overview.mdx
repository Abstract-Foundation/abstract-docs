description: "Link wallets from Ethereum Mainnet to the Abstract Global Wallet."
---

You may want to allow users to perform actions with their Abstract Global Wallet (AGW) based on information from their Ethereum Mainnet wallet, for example to:

- Check if a user is whitelisted for an NFT mint based on their Ethereum Mainnet wallet.
- Read what NFTs or tokens the user holds in their Ethereum Mainnet wallet.

For these use cases, Abstract provides the [DelegateRegistry](https://sepolia.abscan.org/address/0x0000000059A24EB229eED07Ac44229DB56C5d797#code#F1#L16) contract to that allows users to make a *link* between their Ethereum Mainnet wallet and their AGW.

This link is created by having users sign a transaction on Ethereum Mainnet that includes their Abstract Global Wallet address; creating a way for applications to read what wallets are linked to an AGW.

The linking process is available in the SDK to enable you to perform the link in your application, however users can also
perform the link directly on [Abstract&rsquo;s Global Linking page](https://link-testnet.abs.xyz/).

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link wallets">
    On Ethereum Mainnet, users submit a transaction that calls the [delegateAll](https://sepolia.abscan.org/address/0x0000000059A24EB229eED07Ac44229DB56C5d797#code#F1#L44) function on the
    [DelegateRegistry](https://sepolia.abscan.org/address/0x0000000059A24EB229eED07Ac44229DB56C5d797#code#F1#L16) contract to initialize a link between their Ethereum Mainnet wallet and their Abstract Global Wallet:

Once submitted, the delegation information is bridged from Ethereum to Abstract via the [BridgeHub](https://sepolia.abscan.org/address/0x35A54c8C757806eB6820629bc82d90E056394C92) 
contract to become available on Abstract.

You can trigger this flow in your application by using the [linkToAgw](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/wallet-linking/linkToAgw) function.

  <Step title="Check linked wallets">
  
    To view the linked EOAs for an AGW and vice versa, the [ExclusiveDelegateResolver](https://sepolia.abscan.org/address/0x0000000078CC4Cc1C14E27c0fa35ED6E5E58825D#code#F1#L19)
    contract can be used, which contains the following functions to read delegation information:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="exclusiveWalletByRights">
    Given an EOA address as input, returns either:
    - ✅ If the EOA has an AGW linked: the AGW address.
    - ❌ If the EOA does not have an AGW linked: the EOA address.

    Use this to check if an EOA has an AGW linked, or to validate that an AGW is performing a transaction on behalf of a linked EOA 
    
    ```solidity
    function exclusiveWalletByRights(
      address vault,    // The AGW address
      bytes24 rights   // The rights identifier to check
    ) returns (address)
    ```

    Use the following `rights` value to check the AGW link:

    ```solidity
    bytes24 constant _AGW_LINK_RIGHTS = bytes24(keccak256("AGW_LINK"));
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="delegatedWalletsByRights">
    Given an AGW address as input, returns a list of L1 wallets that have linked to the AGW.
    Use this to check what EOAs have been linked to a specific AGW (can be multiple).

    ```solidity
    function delegatedWalletsByRights(
      address wallet,   // The AGW to check delegations for
      bytes24 rights   // The rights identifier to check
    ) returns (address[])
    ```

    Use the following `rights` value to check the AGW link:

    ```solidity
    bytes24 constant _AGW_LINK_RIGHTS = bytes24(keccak256("AGW_LINK"));
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="exclusiveOwnerByRights">
    Given an NFT contract address and token ID as input, returns:

    - ✅ If the NFT owner has linked an AGW: the AGW address.
    - ❌ If the NFT owner has not linked an AGW: the NFT owner address.

    ```solidity
    function exclusiveOwnerByRights(
      address contractAddress,  // The ERC721 contract address
      uint256 tokenId,         // The token ID to check
      bytes24 rights           // The rights identifier to check
    ) returns (address)
    ```
    
    Use the following `rights` value to check the AGW link:

    ```solidity
    bytes24 constant _AGW_LINK_RIGHTS = bytes24(keccak256("AGW_LINK"));
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

This information can be read using the SDK methods; [getLinkedAgw](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/wallet-linking/getLinkedAgw) and [getLinkedAccounts](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/wallet-linking/getLinkedAccounts).
