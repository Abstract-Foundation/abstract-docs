### Who holds the private keys to the AGW?

As described in the [how it works](/abstract-global-wallet/architecture) section, the
private key of the EOA that is the approved signer of the AGW smart contract
is generated and split into three shards.

- **Device Share**: This shard is stored on the user&rsquo;s device. In a browser environment, it is stored inside the local storage of the Privy iframe.
- **Auth Share**: This shard is encrypted and stored on Privy&rsquo;s servers. It is retrieved when the user logs in with their original login method.
- **Recovery Share**: This shard is stored in a backup location of the user&rsquo;s choice, typically a cloud storage account such as Google Drive or iCloud.

### Does the user need to create their AGW on the Abstract website?

No, users don&rsquo;t need to leave your application to create their AGW, any application that integrates the wallet connection flow
supports both creating a new AGW and connecting an existing AGW.

For example, the [live demo](https://create-abstract-app.vercel.app/) showcases how both users without an existing AGW
can create one from within the application and existing AGW users can connect their AGW to the application and begin approving transactions.

### Who deploys the AGW smart contracts?

A factory smart contract deploys each AGW smart contract. The generated EOA sends the transaction to deploy the AGW smart contract via the factory,
and initializes the smart contract with itself as the approved signer.

Using the [SDK](/abstract-global-wallet/getting-started), this transaction is sponsored by a [paymaster](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/paymasters),
meaning users don&rsquo;t need to load their EOA with any funds to deploy the AGW smart contract to get started.

### Does the AGW smart contract work on other chains?

Abstract Global Wallet is built on top of [native account abstraction](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/overview);
a feature unique to Abstract. While the smart contract code is EVM-compatible, the SDK is not chain-agnostic and only works on Abstract
due to the technical differences between Abstract and other EVM-compatible chains.
