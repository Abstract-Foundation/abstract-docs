Session keys are temporary keys that are approved to execute a pre-defined set of actions on behalf of an Abstract Global Wallet without requiring the owner to sign each transaction.

They unlock seamless user experiences by executing transactions behind the scenes without interrupting the user with popups; powerful for games, mobile apps, and more.

<Warning>
  Session keys are permissionless on **testnet**, however, **mainnet** requires applications to pass a security review before being added to the [Session Key Policy Registry](/abstract-global-wallet/session-keys/going-to-production#session-key-policy-registry). See [Going to Production](/abstract-global-wallet/session-keys/going-to-production) for details.
</Warning>

## How session keys work

Applications can prompt users to approve the creation of a session key for their Abstract Global Wallet.
This session key specifies:

- A scoped set of actions that the session key is approved to execute.
- A specific EOA account, the **signer**, that is permitted to execute the scoped actions.

If the user approves the session key creation, the **signer** account can submit any of the actions within the defined scope without requiring user confirmation; until the session key expires or is revoked.

## How to use session keys

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a session key">
    Create a new session key that defines specific actions allowed to be executed on behalf of the Abstract Global Wallet using [createSession](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/session-keys/createSession) or [useCreateSession](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-react/hooks/useCreateSession).

    This session key configuration defines a **signer account** that is approved to execute the actions defined in the session on behalf of the Abstract Global Wallet.

    <Warning>
      Session keys must be whitelisted on the [session key policy registry](/abstract-global-wallet/session-keys/going-to-production#session-key-policy-registry)
      to be used on Abstract mainnet following a security review.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Store the session key">
    Store the session key securely using the guidelines outlined in [Going to Production](/abstract-global-wallet/session-keys/going-to-production#session-key-signer-accounts).
    The session config is required for the session key to be used to execute actions on behalf of the Abstract Global Wallet.

    The signer account(s) defined in the session configuration objects are **sensitive values** that must be stored securely.

     <Warning>
      Use the recommendations for [session key signer accounts](/abstract-global-wallet/session-keys/going-to-production#session-key-signer-accounts)
      outlined in [Going to Production](/abstract-global-wallet/session-keys/going-to-production)
      to ensure the signer account(s) are stored securely.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the session key">
    Create a `SessionClient` instance using either:

    - [toSessionClient](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/session-keys/toSessionClient) if you have an existing [AbstractClient](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/createAbstractClient) available.
    - [createSessionClient](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/session-keys/createSessionClient) if you don&rsquo;t already have an [AbstractClient](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/createAbstractClient), such as from a backend environment.

    Use the client to submit transactions and perform actions (e.g. [writeContract](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/actions/writeContract)) without requiring the user to approve each transaction. Transactions are signed by the session key account and are submitted `from` the Abstract Global Wallet.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Optional - Revoke the session key">
    Session keys naturally expire after the duration specified in the session configuration.
    However, if you need to revoke a session key before it expires, you can do so using [revokeSessions](/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/session-keys/revokeSessions).

  </Step>
