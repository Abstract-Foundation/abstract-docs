While session keys unlock new ways to create engaging consumer experiences, improper or malicious implementations of session keys
create new ways for bad actors to steal assets from users.

Session keys are permissionless on **testnet**, however, **mainnet** enforces several security measures to protect users.
This document outlines the security restrictions and best practices for using session keys.

## Session Key Policy Registry

Session keys are restricted to a whitelist of allowed policies on Abstract Mainnet through the [Session Key Policy Registry contract](https://abscan.org/address/0xA146c7118A46b32aBD0e1ACA41DF4e61061b6b93#code), which manages a whitelist of approved session keys.

Applications must pass a security review before being added to the
registry to enable the use of session keys for their policies.

### Restricted Session Key Policies

Session key policies that request `approve` and/or `setApprovalForAll` functions _must_ be passed with additional `constraints` that restrict the approval to a specific contract address.

For example, the following policy must include a `constraints` array that restricts the approval to a specific contract address,
or will be rejected with "Unconstrained token approval/transfer destination in call policy."

```typescript
{
  target: "0x...",
  selector: toFunctionSelector("approve(address, uint256)"),
  // ... must include a constraints array that restricts the approval to a specific contract address
}
```

## Session Key Signer Accounts

Session keys specify a **signer** account; an <Tooltip tip="Externally Owned Account, i.e. a public/private key pair.">EOA</Tooltip> that is permitted to perform the actions specified in the session configuration. Therefore, the private key of the signer(s) you create are **SENSITIVE VALUES**!

Exposing the signer private key enables attackers to execute any of the actions specified in a session configuration for any AGW that has approved a session key with that signer&rsquo;s address.

```typescript
await agwClient.createSession({
  session: {
    signer: sessionSigner.address, // <--- The session key signer account
    // ...
  },
});
```

Below, we provide recommended approaches to implement secure session key signer storage.

### Privy Server Wallets

[Privy Server Wallets](https://docs.privy.io/guide/server-wallets/) provide a secure way to create and store signer account(s) for session keys using trusted execution environments (TEEs); ensuring private keys can only ever be reassembled within a secure enclave and never exposed to perform any malicious actions.

By using a Privy Server Wallet as the session key signer, attackers cannot compromise the TEE to access the signer account private key to perform any malicious actions.

### Unique Signer Accounts per Config

If you want to store session signer accounts on the client, such as in the browser&rsquo;s [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) or [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API), you must create a new unique signer account for each session key to limit the impact of a compromised signer account.

If an attacker gains access to a signer account by compromising the user&rsquo;s client, generating unique signer accounts isolates the attack to a single Abstract Global Wallet.

Browser storage methods are vulnerable to Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which can expose the signer account private key to attackers. It is recommended to first **encrypt** the signer account private key before storing it on the client.

It is **not acceptable** to use a single signer account stored on the client for all session keys.
