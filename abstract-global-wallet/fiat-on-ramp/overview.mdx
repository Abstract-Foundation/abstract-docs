To provide a consumer-friendly onboarding experience to non-crypto-native users,
Abstract supports a FIAT on-ramp powered by [Meld](https://www.meld.io/). 

This enables users in over 200 countries to fund their Abstract Global Wallet using their local currency via a credit card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay.

## How it works

The FIAT on-ramp works by presenting users with a **widget** that prompts the user for their payment details to fulfill a **quote**. The quote determines the amount, address, currency, and other details of the transaction.

This flow can be broken down into three steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Collecting User Information">
    To generate a **quote**, information about the user and their desired on-ramp transaction is required, including the user&rsquo;s country, wallet address, desired amount, etc. (see [/quote](/abstract-global-wallet/fiat-on-ramp/quote) for more details).

    Present users with a form to collect the required information, making use of the below endpoints to localize and validate the user&rsquo;s input:

    - [/config](/abstract-global-wallet/fiat-on-ramp/config) to get the user&rsquo;s country and local currency information.
    - [/currencies](/abstract-global-wallet/fiat-on-ramp/currencies) to get the available currencies for the user&rsquo;s country.
    - [/payment-methods](/abstract-global-wallet/fiat-on-ramp/payment-methods) to get the available payment methods for the user&rsquo;s country.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Fetching Quotes">
    After collecting the required information from the user, call the [/quote endpoint](/abstract-global-wallet/fiat-on-ramp/quote) to get an array of quotes from providers that can fulfill the given request.

    Choose *(or allow the user to choose)* the best quote for your application&rsquo;s needs.
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Fulfilling the Quote">
    Provide your selected quote to the [/widget endpoint](/abstract-global-wallet/fiat-on-ramp/widget) to generate a widget URL that can be either opened directly or embedded in your application using an iframe.

    The widget URL presents the user with a form to enter their payment details and complete the transaction. Use the [/transactions endpoint](/abstract-global-wallet/fiat-on-ramp/transactions) to track the status of their order using the session ID returned from the widget.
    </Step> 

</Steps>

Under the hood, funds are first loaded to a temporary deposit address on the [Base network](https://www.base.org/) before being bridged to the desired destination address on Abstract.
