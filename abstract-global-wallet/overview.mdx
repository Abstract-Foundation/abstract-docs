## What is Abstract Global Wallet?

Abstract Global Wallet (AGW) is a cross-application
[smart contract wallet](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/smart-contract-wallets) that
users can create to interact with any application built on Abstract,
powered by [native account abstraction](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction).

AGW provides a seamless and secure way to onboard users, in which
they sign up once using familiar login methods (such as email, social accounts,
passkeys and more), and can then use this account to interact with _any_ application on Abstract.
