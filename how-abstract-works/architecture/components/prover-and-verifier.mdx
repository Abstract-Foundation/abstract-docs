The batches of transactions submitted to Ethereum by the [sequencer](/how-abstract-works/architecture/components/sequencer)
are not necessarily valid (i.e. they have not been proven to be correct) until a ZK proof is generated
and verified by the [L1 rollup contract](/how-abstract-works/architecture/components/l1-rollup-contracts).

ZK proofs are used in a two-step process to ensure the correctness of batches:

1. **[Proof generation](#proof-generation)**: An **off-chain** prover generates a ZK proof that a batch of transactions is valid.
2. **[Proof verification](#proof-verification)**: The proof is submitted to the [L1 rollup contract](/how-abstract-works/architecture/components/l1-rollup-contracts) and verified by the **on-chain** verifier.

Since the proof verification is performed on Ethereum, Abstract inherits the security guarantees of the Ethereum L1.

## Proof Generation

The proof generation process is composed of three main steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Witness Generation">
    A **witness** is the cryptographic term for the knowledge 
    that the prover wishes to demonstrate is true. 
    In the context of Abstract, the witness is the data that the prover uses to claim a transaction is valid without disclosing any transaction details.
  
    Witnesses are collected in batches and processed together.

    </Card>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Circuit Execution">
    
    Circuits are executed by the prover and the verifier, where the prover uses 
    the witness to generate a proof, and the verifier checks this proof against the 
    circuit to confirm its validity.
    [View the full list of circuits on the ZK Stack documentation](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/components/prover/circuits).

    The goal of these circuits is to ensure the correct execution of the VM,
    covering every [opcode](/how-abstract-works/evm-differences/evm-opcodes),
    storage interaction, and the integration of [precompiled contracts](/how-abstract-works/evm-differences/precompiles).

    The ZK-proving circuit iterates over the entire transaction batch,
    verifying the sequence of updates that result in a final state root after the last transaction is executed.

    Abstract uses [Boojum](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/components/prover/boojum-gadgets)
    to prove and verify the circuit functionality, along with operating the backend components necessary for circuit construction.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Proof Compression">
    The circuit outputs a 
    [ZK-STARK](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/#validity-proofs);
    a type of validity proof that is relatively large and therefore would be more costly 
    to post on Ethereum to be verified.

    For this reason, a final compression step is performed to generate a succinct validity proof
    called a [ZK-SNARK](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/#validity-proofs)
    that can be [verified](#proof-verification) quickly and cheaply on Ethereum.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Proof Verification

The final ZK-SNARK generated from the proof generation phase is
submitted with the `proveBatches` function call to the
[L1 rollup contract](/how-abstract-works/architecture/components/l1-rollup-contracts) as outlined in the
[transaction lifecycle](/how-abstract-works/architecture/transaction-lifecycle) section.

The ZK proof is then verified by the verifier smart contract on Ethereum by calling
its `verify` function and providing the proof as an argument.

```solidity
// Returns a boolean value indicating whether the zk-SNARK proof is valid.
function verify(
    uint256[] calldata _publicInputs,
    uint256[] calldata _proof,
    uint256[] calldata _recursiveAggregationInput
) external view returns (bool);
```
