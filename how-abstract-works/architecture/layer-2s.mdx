Abstract is a [layer 2](#what-is-a-layer-2) (L2) blockchain that creates batches of transactions and posts them to Ethereum to inherit
Ethereum&rsquo;s security properties. Specifically, Abstract
is a [ZK Rollup](#what-is-a-zk-rollup) built with the [ZK stack](#what-is-the-zk-stack).

By posting and verifying batches of transactions on Ethereum,
Abstract provides strong security guarantees while also enabling fast and cheap transactions.

## What is a Layer 2?

A layer 2 (L2) is a collective term that refers to a set of
blockchains that are built to scale Ethereum.

Since Ethereum is only able to process roughly 15 transactions per second (TPS), often with
expensive gas fees, it is not feasible for consumer applications to run on Ethereum directly.

The main goal of an L2 is therefore to both increase the transaction throughput
_(i.e. how many transactions can be processed per second)_, and reduce the
cost of gas fees for those transactions, **without** sacrificing decentralization or security.

## What is a ZK Rollup?

A ZK (Zero-Knowledge) Rollup is a type of L2 that uses zero-knowledge proofs to
verify the validity of batches of transactions that are posted to Ethereum.

As the L2 posts batches of transactions to Ethereum, it is important to ensure that the
transactions are valid and the state of the L2 is correct. This is done by using
zero-knowledge proofs (called [validity proofs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/#validity-proofs))
to confirm the correctness of the state transitions in the batch
without having to re-execute the transactions on Ethereum.

## What is the ZK Stack?

Abstract uses the [ZK stack](https://zkstack.io/components);
an open-source framework for building sovereign ZK rollups.
