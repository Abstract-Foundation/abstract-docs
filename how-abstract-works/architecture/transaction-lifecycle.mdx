As explained in the [layer 2s](/how-abstract-works/architecture/layer-2s)
section, Abstract inherits the security properties of Ethereum by posting
batches of L2 transactions to the L1 and using ZK proofs to ensure their correctness.

This relationship is implemented using both off-chain components as well
as multiple smart contracts _(on both L1 and L2)_ to transfer batches of
transactions, enforce [data availability](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-availability/),
ensure the validity of the ZK proofs, and more.

Each transaction goes through a flow that can broadly be separated into four phases,
which can be seen for each transaction on our [block explorers](/ecosystem/block-explorers):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Abstract (Processed)">
    The transaction is executed and soft confirmation is 
    provided back to the user about the execution of their transaction (i.e. if their transaction succeeded or not).

    After execution, the sequencer both forwards the block to the prover and creates a
    batch containing transactions from multiple blocks.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Ethereum (sending)">
    Multiple batches are committed to Ethereum in a
    single transaction
    in the form of an optimized data submission that only details the changes
    in blockchain state; called a
    **<Tooltip tip="State diffs offer a more cost-effective approach to transactions than full
    transaction data. By omitting signatures and publishing only the final state when multiple
    transactions alter the same slots.">state diff</Tooltip>**.

    This step is one of the roles of the [sequencer](/how-abstract-works/architecture/components/sequencer);
    calling the `commitBatches` function on the [L1 rollup contract](/how-abstract-works/architecture/components/l1-rollup-contracts) and
    ensuring the [data availability](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-availability/) of these batches.

    The batches are stored on Ethereum using [blobs](https://info.etherscan.com/what-is-a-blob/) following the [EIP-4844](https://www.eip4844.com/) standard.

    </Step>

  <Step title="Ethereum (validating)">
    A ZK proof that validates the batches is generated and submitted to the 
    L1 rollup contract for verification by calling the contract&rsquo;s
    `proveBatches` function.

    This process involves both the [prover](/how-abstract-works/architecture/components/prover-and-verifier), which is responsible for
    generating the ZK proof off-chain in the form of a [ZK-SNARK](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/#validity-proofs)
    & submitting it to the L1 rollup contract as well as the [verifier](/how-abstract-works/architecture/components/prover-and-verifier), which
    is responsible for confirming the validity of the proof on-chain.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Ethereum (executing)">
    Shortly after validation is complete, the state is finalized and the Merkle tree with L2 logs is saved
    by calling the `executeBatches` function on the L1 rollup contract. [Learn more about state commitments](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/#state-commitments).
