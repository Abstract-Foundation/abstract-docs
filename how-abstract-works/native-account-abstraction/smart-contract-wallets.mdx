description: "Learn how smart contract wallets are built following the IAccount standard on Abstract."
---

On Abstract, all accounts are smart contracts that implement the
[IAccount](#iaccount-interface) interface. As outlined in the [transaction flow](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/transaction-flow),
the bootloader calls the functions of the smart contract account deployed at the `tx.from` address for
each transaction that it processes.

Abstract maintains compatibility with popular EOA wallets from the Ethereum ecosystem (e.g. MetaMask) by
converting them to the [DefaultAccount](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/smart-contract-wallets#defaultaccount-contract) system contract during the transaction flow.
This contract acts as you would expect an EOA to act, with the added benefit of supporting paymasters.

## Get Started with Smart Contract Wallets

Use our [example repositories](https://github.com/Abstract-Foundation/examples)
to quickly get started building smart contract wallets.

## IAccount Interface

The `IAccount` interface defines the mandatory functions that a smart contract account must implement to be
compatible with Abstract. [View source code ↗](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/blob/main/system-contracts/contracts/interfaces/IAccount.sol).

First, install the [system contracts library](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/using-system-contracts#installing-system-contracts):

<CodeGroup>

```bash Hardhat
npm install @matterlabs/zksync-contracts
```

```bash Foundry
forge install matter-labs/era-contracts
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Ensure you have the `isSystem` flag set to `true` in your config:
  [Hardhat](/build-on-abstract/smart-contracts/hardhat#using-system-contracts) ‧
  [Foundry](/build-on-abstract/smart-contracts/foundry#3-modify-foundry-configuration)
</Note>

Then, import and implement the `IAccount` interface in your smart contract:

```solidity
import {IAccount} from "@matterlabs/zksync-contracts/l2/system-contracts/interfaces/IAccount.sol";

contract SmartAccount is IAccount {
  // Implement the interface (see docs below)
    // validateTransaction
    // executeTransaction
    // executeTransactionFromOutside
    // payForTransaction
    // prepareForPaymaster
}
```

See the [DefaultAccount contract](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/blob/main/system-contracts/contracts/DefaultAccount.sol)
for an example implementation.

### validateTransaction

This function is called to determine whether or not the transaction should be executed (i.e. it validates the transaction).
Typically, you would perform some kind of check in this step to restrict who can use the account. This function must:

1. Increment the nonce for the account. See [handling nonces](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/handling-nonces) for more information.
2. Return `magic = ACCOUNT_VALIDATION_SUCCESS_MAGIC` if the transaction is valid and should be executed.
3. Should only be called by the bootloader contract (e.g. using an `onlyBootloader` modifier).

```solidity
function validateTransaction(
    bytes32 _txHash,
    bytes32 _suggestedSignedHash,
    Transaction calldata _transaction
) external payable returns (bytes4 magic);
```

### executeTransaction

This function is called if the validation step
returned the `ACCOUNT_VALIDATION_SUCCESS_MAGIC` value. Consider:

1. Using the [EfficientCall](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/blob/main/system-contracts/contracts/libraries/EfficientCall.sol)
   library for executing transactions efficiently using zkEVM-specific features.
2. Consider that the transaction may involve a contract deployment, in which case you should
   use the [ContractDeployer](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#contractdeployer)
   system contract with the `isSystemCall` flag set to true.
3. Should only be called by the bootloader contract (e.g. using an `onlyBootloader` modifier).

```solidity
function executeTransaction(
    bytes32 _txHash,
    bytes32 _suggestedSignedHash,
    Transaction calldata _transaction
) external payable;
```

### executeTransactionFromOutside

This function should be used to initiate a transaction from the smart contract wallet by an external call.
Accounts can implement this method to initiate a transaction on behalf of the account via L1 -> L2 communication.

```solidity
function executeTransactionFromOutside(
    Transaction calldata _transaction
) external payable;
```

### payForTransaction

This function is called to pay the bootloader for the gas fee of the transaction.
It should only be called by the bootloader contract (e.g. using an `onlyBootloader` modifier).

For convenience, there is a `_transaction.payToTheBootloader()` function that can be used
to pay the bootloader for the gas fee.

```solidity
function payForTransaction(
    bytes32 _txHash,
    bytes32 _suggestedSignedHash,
    Transaction calldata _transaction
) external payable;
```

### prepareForPaymaster

Alternatively to `payForTransaction`, if the transaction has a paymaster set,
you can use `prepareForPaymaster` to ask the paymaster to sponsor the gas fee for the transaction.
It should only be called by the bootloader contract (e.g. using an `onlyBootloader` modifier).

For convenience, there is a `_transaction.processPaymasterInput()` function that can be used to prepare the
transaction for the paymaster.

```solidity
function prepareForPaymaster(
    bytes32 _txHash,
    bytes32 _possibleSignedHash,
    Transaction calldata _transaction
) external payable;
```

## Deploying a Smart Contract Wallet

The [ContractDeployer](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#contractdeployer) system contract has separate functions
for deploying smart contract wallets: `createAccount` and `create2Account`.

Differentiate deploying an account contract from deploying a regular contract by providing either of these function names
when initializing a contract factory.

<Accordion title="View example zksync-ethers script">

```typescript
import { ContractFactory } from "zksync-ethers";

const contractFactory = new ContractFactory(
  abi,
  bytecode,
  initiator,
  "createAccount" // Provide the fourth argument as "createAccount" or "create2Account"
);
const aa = await contractFactory.deploy();
await aa.deployed();
```

</Accordion>

## Sending Transactions from a Smart Contract Wallet

Use [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) formatted transactions to submit transactions from a smart contract wallet.
You must specify:

1. The `from` field as the address of the deployed smart contract wallet.
2. Provide a `customData` object containing a `customSignature` that is not an empty string.

<Accordion title="View example zksync-ethers script">

```typescript
import { VoidSigner } from "ethers";
import { Provider, utils } from "zksync-ethers";
import { serializeEip712 } from "zksync-ethers/build/utils";

// Here we are just creating a transaction object that we want to send to the network.
// This is just an example to populate fields like gas estimation, nonce calculation, etc.
const transactionGenerator = new VoidSigner(getWallet().address, getProvider());
const transactionFields = await transactionGenerator.populateTransaction({
  to: "0x8e729E23CDc8bC21c37a73DA4bA9ebdddA3C8B6d", // As an example, send money to another wallet
});

// Now: Serialize an EIP-712 transaction
const serializedTx = serializeEip712({
  ...transactionFields,
  nonce: 0,
  from: "YOUR-SMART-CONTRACT-WALLET-CONTRACT-ADDRESS", // Your smart contract wallet address goes here
  customData: {
    customSignature: "0x1337", // Your custom signature goes here
  },
});

// Broadcast the transaction to the network via JSON-RPC
const sentTx = await new Provider(
  "https://api.testnet.abs.xyz"
).broadcastTransaction(serializedTx);
const resp = await sentTx.wait();
```

</Accordion>

## DefaultAccount Contract

The `DefaultAccount` contract is a system contract that mimics the behaviour of an EOA.
The bytecode of the contract is set by default for all addresses for which no other bytecodes are deployed.
