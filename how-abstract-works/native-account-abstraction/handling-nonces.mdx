title: "Handling Nonces"
description: "Learn the best practices for handling nonces when building smart contract accounts on Abstract."

As outlined in the [tranasction flow](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/transaction-flow), a call to `validateNonceUsage`
is made to the [NonceHolder](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#nonceholder) system contract
before each transaction starts, in order to check whether the provided nonce
of a transaction has already been used or not.

The bootloader enforces that the nonce:

1. Has not already been used before transaction validation begins.
2. The nonce _is_ used (typically incremented) during transaction validation.

## Considering nonces in your smart contract account

{/* If you submit a nonce that is greater than the next expected nonce, the transaction will not be executed until each preceding nonce has been used. */}

As mentioned above, you must "use" the nonce in the validation step.
To mark a nonce as used there are two options:

1. Increment the `minNonce`: All nonces less than `minNonce` will become used.
2. Set a non-zero value under the nonce via `setValueUnderNonce`.

A convenience method, `incrementMinNonceIfEquals` is exposed
from the `NonceHolder` system contract. For example, inside of your [smart contract wallet](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/smart-contract-wallets),
you can use it to increment the `minNonce` of your account.

In order to use the [NonceHolder](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#nonceholder) system contract,
the `isSystem` flag must be set to `true` in the transaction, which can be done by using the `SystemContractsCaller` library shown below.
