<Note>The EVM interpreter is currently only available on **testnet**.</Note>

Abstract natively uses the [ZKsync VM](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-protocol/vm) to execute smart contract instructions,
however an **EVM bytecode interpreter** system is also available to enable the deployment of unmodified EVM bytecode,
commonly referred to as "EVM equivalent" smart contracts.

This enables smart contracts that rely on EVM logic (such as consistent address derivation)
to be deployed on Abstract without modification, but is not recommended for most use cases
due to comparatively higher gas fees.

## How It Works

There are two ways to deploy smart contracts on Abstract:

- **ZKsync VM Bytecode**: Compile contracts into ZK-EVM bytecode and deploy to Abstract. These contracts are executed natively by Abstract&rsquo;s ZKsync VM. Recommended for most use cases.
- **EVM Bytecode**: Compile contracts into EVM bytecode and deploy to Abstract. Contracts deployed this way are flagged as EVM bytecode and are executed via the EVM interpreter. During execution, the EVM opcodes are translated into the ZKsync VM's instruction set and executed by the ZKsync VM. Recommended only for use cases that require specific EVM features not supported by the ZKsync VM (see [EVM differences](/how-abstract-works/evm-differences/overview)).

### Opcode Translation & Gas Fees

The EVM interpreter functions as a translation layer that converts
EVM opcodes into ZKsync VM operations at runtime as part of the smart contract execution process.

As a consequence of this translation process, contracts deployed with EVM bytecode experience **increased gas fees of between 150-400%**
compared to contracts deployed using the native ZKsync VM bytecode.
