While Abstract is EVM-compatible and allows you to use familiar development tools from the Ethereum ecosystem, the bytecode that Abstract’s VM (the [ZKsync VM](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/era-vm)) understands is different from what Ethereum’s [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) understands.

These differences exist both to optimize the VM for efficiency with ZK proofs and to provide more powerful ways for developers to build consumer-facing applications.

When building smart contracts on Abstract, it’s helpful to understand the differences between Abstract and Ethereum and how to best leverage them to create the best experience for your users.
