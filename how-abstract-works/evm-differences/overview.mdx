While Abstract is EVM compatible and you can use familiar development
tools from the Ethereum ecosystem, the bytecode that Abstract&rsquo;s VM
(the [ZKsync VM](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/era-vm)) understands
is different than what Ethereum&rsquo;s [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) understands.

These differences exist to both optimize the VM to perform efficiently with ZK proofs
and to provide more powerful ways for developers to build consumer-facing applications.

When building smart contracts on Abstract, it&rsquo;s helpful to understand what the differences
are between Abstract and Ethereum, and how best to leverage these differences to
create the best experience for your users.
