Unlike Ethereum, Abstract does not store the bytecode of smart contracts directly;
instead, it stores a hash of the bytecode and publishes the bytecode itself to Ethereum.

This adds several benefits to smart contract deployments on Abstract, including:

- **Inherited L1 Security**: Smart contract bytecode is stored directly on Ethereum.
- **Increased Gas efficiency**: Only _unique_ contract bytecode needs to be published on Ethereum.
  If you deploy the same contract more than once _(such as when using a factory)_, subsequent contract deployments are substantially cheaper.

## How Contract Deployment Works

**Contracts cannot be deployed on Abstract unless the bytecode of the smart contract to be deployed is published on Ethereum.**
If the bytecode of the contract has not been published, the deployment transaction will fail with the error `the code hash is not known`.

To publish bytecode before deployment, all contract deployments on Abstract are performed by calling the 
[ContractDeployer](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#contractdeployer) system contract
using one of its
[create](#create),
[create2](#create2),
[createAccount](#createaccount), or
[create2Account](#create2account) functions.

The bytecode of your smart contract and any other smart contracts that it can deploy _(such as when using a factory)_
must be included inside the factory dependencies (`factoryDeps`) of the deployment transaction.

Typically, this process occurs under the hood and is performed by the compiler and client libraries.
This page will show you how to deploy smart contracts on Abstract by interacting with the
[ContractDeployer](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#contractdeployer) system contract.

## Deploying Smart Contracts

When building smart contracts, the [zksolc](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksolc-bin) and [zkvyper](https://github.com/matter-labs/zkvyper-bin)
compilers transform calls to the `CREATE` and `CREATE2` opcodes into calls to the `create` and `create2` functions on the `ContractDeployer` system contract.

In addition, when you call either of these opcodes, the compiler automatically detects what other contracts
your contract is capable of deploying and includes them in the `factoryDeps` field
of the generated artifacts.

### Solidity

No Solidity changes are required to deploy smart contracts, as the compiler handles the transformation automatically.
_Note_: address derivation via
`CREATE` and `CREATE2` is different from Ethereum.

#### create

Below are examples of how to write a smart contract that deploys other smart contracts
using the `CREATE` opcode. The compiler will automatically transform these calls
into calls to the `create` function on the `ContractDeployer` system contract.

#### createAccount

When deploying [smart contract wallets](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/smart-contract-wallets) on Abstract,
manually call the `createAccount` or `create2Account` function on the `ContractDeployer` system contract.
This is required because the contract needs to be flagged as a smart contract wallet by setting
the fourth argument of the `createAccount` function to the account abstraction version.

#### create2Account

Similar to the `createAccount` function, the `create2Account` function on the `ContractDeployer` system contract must be
called manually when deploying smart contract wallets on Abstract to
flag the contract as a smart contract wallet by setting the fourth argument of the `create2Account` function to the account abstraction version.

### EIP-712 Transactions via Clients

Once your smart contracts are compiled and you have the bytecode(s),
you can use various client libraries to deploy your smart contracts by creating
[EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) transactions that:

- Have the transaction type set to `113` (to indicate an EIP-712 transaction).
- Call the `create`, `create2`, `createAccount`, or `create2Account` function `to` the 
    `ContractDeployer` system contract address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000008006`).
- Include the bytecode of the smart contract and any other contracts it can deploy in the `customData.factoryDeps`
  field of the transaction.

#### hardhat-zksync

Since the compiler automatically generates the `factoryDeps` field for you in the contract artifact _(unless you are manually
calling the `ContractDeployer` via `createAccount` or `create2Account` functions)_,
load the artifact of the contract and use the [Deployer](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-era/tooling/hardhat/plugins/hardhat-zksync-deploy#deployer-export)
class from the `hardhat-zksync` plugin to deploy the contract.

## How Bytecode Publishing Works

When a contract is deployed on Abstract, multiple [system contracts](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts)
work together to compress and publish the contract bytecode to Ethereum before the contract is deployed.

Once the bytecode is published, the hash of the bytecode is set to "known"; meaning
the contract can be deployed on Abstract without needing to publish the bytecode again.

The process can be broken down into the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Bootloader processes transaction">
    The [bootloader](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/bootloader) receives
    an [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) transaction that defines
    a contract deployment. This transaction must:

    1. Call the `create` or `create2` function on the `ContractDeployer` system contract.
    2. Provide a salt, the formatted hash of the contract bytecode, and the constructor calldata as arguments.
    3. Inside the `factory_deps` field of the transaction, include the bytecode of the smart contract being deployed
    as well as the bytecodes of any other contracts that this contract can deploy (such as if it is a factory contract).

    <Accordion title="See the create function signature">

      ```solidity
      /// @notice Deploys a contract with similar address derivation rules to the EVM's `CREATE` opcode.
      /// @param _bytecodeHash The correctly formatted hash of the bytecode.
      /// @param _input The constructor calldata
      /// @dev This method also accepts nonce as one of its parameters.
      /// It is not used anywhere and it needed simply for the consistency for the compiler
      /// Note: this method may be callable only in system mode,
      /// that is checked in the `createAccount` by `onlySystemCall` modifier.
      function create(
          bytes32 _salt,
          bytes32 _bytecodeHash,
          bytes calldata _input
      ) external payable override returns (address) {
        // ...
      }
    ```

    </Accordion>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Marking contract as known and publishing compressed bytedata">
    Under the hood, the bootloader informs the
    [KnownCodesStorage](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#knowncodesstorage) system contract
    about the contract code hash.
    This is required for all contract deployments on Abstract.

    The `KnownCodesStorage` then calls the
    [Compressor](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#compressor), which subsequently calls the
    [L1Messenger](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#l1messenger)
    system contract to publish the hash of the compressed contract bytecode to
    Ethereum (assuming this contract code has not been deployed before).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Smart contract account execution">
    Once the bootloader finishes calling the other system contracts to ensure the contract code hash is known,
    and the contract code is published to Ethereum,
    it continues executing the transaction as described in the 
    [transaction flow](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/transaction-flow) section.

    This flow includes invoking the contract deployer account&rsquo;s `validateTransaction` and `executeTransaction` functions; which
    will determine whether to deploy the contract and how to execute the deployment transaction respectively.

    Learn more about these functions on the [smart contract wallets](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/smart-contract-wallets) section, or
    view an example implementation in the [DefaultAccount](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#defaultaccount).
