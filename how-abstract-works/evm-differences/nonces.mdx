Unlike Ethereum, where each account has a single nonce that increments every transaction,
accounts on Abstract maintain two different nonces:

1. **Transaction nonce**: Used for transaction validation.
2. **Deployment nonce**: Incremented when a contract is deployed.

In addition, nonces are not restricted to increment once per transaction
like on Ethereum due to Abstract&rsquo;s [native account abstraction](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/overview.mdx).

There are also other minor differences between Abstract and Ethereum nonce management:

- Newly created contracts begin with a deployment nonce value of `0` (as opposed to `1`).
- The deployment nonce is only incremented if the deployment succeeds
  (as opposed to Ethereum, where the nonce is incremented regardless of the deployment outcome).
