description: "Learn more about the Bootloader that processes all transactions on Abstract."
---

The bootloader system contract plays several vital roles on Abstract, responsible for:

- Validating all transactions
- Executing all transactions
- Constructing new blocks for the L2

The bootloader processes transactions in batches that it
receives from the [VM](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/era-vm) and puts
them all through the flow outlined in the
[transaction flow](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/transaction-flow.mdx) section.

## Bootloader Execution Flow

1. As the bootloader receives batches of transactions from the VM, it sends the information
   about the current batch to the [SystemContext system contract](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts.mdx#systemcontext)
   before processing each transaction.

2. As each transaction is processed, it goes through the flow outlined
   in the [gas fees](/how-abstract-works/evm-differences/gas-fees.mdx) section.

3. At the end of each batch, the bootloader informs the [L1Messenger system contract](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts.mdx#l1messenger)
   for it to begin sending data to Ethereum about the transactions that were processed.

## BootloaderUtilities System Contract

In addition to the bootloader itself, there is an additional
[BootloaderUtilities system contract](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/blob/main/system-contracts/contracts/BootloaderUtilities.sol)
that provides utility functions for the bootloader to use.

This separation is simply because the bootloader itself is written in [Yul](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/blob/main/system-contracts/bootloader/bootloader.yul)
whereas the utility functions are written in Solidity.
