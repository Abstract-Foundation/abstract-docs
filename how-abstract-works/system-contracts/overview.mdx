---

Abstract has a set of smart contracts with
special privileges that were deployed in the <Tooltip tip="The first block of the blockchain">Genesis block</Tooltip>
called **system contracts**. These system contracts are built to provide support
for [EVM opcodes](https://www.evm.codes/) that are not natively supported by the ZK-EVM that Abstract uses.

These system contracts are located in a special kernel space
_(i.e. in the address space in range `[0..2^16-1]`)_, and
they can only be changed via a system upgrade through Ethereum.
