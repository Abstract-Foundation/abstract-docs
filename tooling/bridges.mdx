A bridge is a tool that allows users to move assets such as ETH from Ethereum to Abstract and vice versa.
Under the hood, bridging works by having two smart contracts deployed:

1. A smart contract deployed to Ethereum (L1).
2. A smart contract deployed to Abstract (L2).

These smart contracts communicate with each other to facilitate the deposit and withdrawal of assets between the two chains.

## Native Bridge

Abstract has a native bridge to move assets between Ethereum and
Abstract for free (excluding gas fees) that supports bridging both ETH and ERC-20 tokens.

Deposits from L1 to L2 take around ~15 minutes, whereas
withdrawals from L2 to L1 currently take up to 24 hours due to the
built-in [withdrawal delay](https://docs.zksync.io/build/resources/withdrawal-delay#withdrawal-delay).

## Third Party Bridges

In addition to the native bridge, users can also utilize third-party bridges
to move assets from other chains to Abstract and vice versa.
These bridges offer alternative routes that are typically faster and cheaper than the native bridge,
however come with different **security risks**.
