---

A bridge is a tool that allows users to move assets such as ETH from Ethereum to Abstract and vice versa.
Under the hood, bridging works by having two smart contracts deployed:

1. A smart contract deployed to Ethereum (L1).
2. A smart contract deployed to Abstract (L2).

These smart contracts communicate with each other to facilitate the deposit and withdrawal of assets between the two chains.

## Native Bridge

Abstract has a native bridge to move assets between Ethereum and
Abstract for free (excluding gas fees) that supports bridging both ETH and ERC-20 tokens.

Deposits from L1 to L2 take around ~15 minutes, whereas
withdrawals from L2 to L1 currently take up to 24 hours due to the
built-in [withdrawal delay](https://docs.zksync.io/build/resources/withdrawal-delay#withdrawal-delay).

## Third Party Bridges

In addition to the native bridge, users can also utilize third-party bridges
to move assets between Ethereum and Abstract.
These bridges offer alternative routes and may come with different features but also have different **risks**.

### Relay

Relay provides near-instant transfers between Ethereum and Abstract for a small fee.
It works by connecting users with relayers that act on users&rsquo; behalfs across chains in exchange for a small fee.
