Learn how to build apps on Abstract like [Gacha](https://gacha.game/?ref=Q3FMS2SO), which use Proof of Playâ€™s verifiable random number generator (vRNG) service to provide fair, on-chain randomness for outcomes.

## 1. Foundry project setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Foundry project">
    Create a Foundry project (or configure an existing one) following our [Foundry guide](/build-on-abstract/smart-contracts/foundry/get-started).

        <Card title="Get Started with Foundry" icon="weight-hanging" href="/build-on-abstract/smart-contracts/foundry/get-started">
            Learn how to install and configure foundry-zksync for Abstract.
        </Card>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Absmate">
    Install [Absmate](https://github.com/Abstract-Foundation/absmate); a collection of helpful utilities for building contracts on Abstract.

    ```bash
    forge install abstract-foundation/absmate
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure remappings">

    Add the following to your `remappings.txt` file to use Absmate's contracts.

    ```text title="remappings.txt"
    absmate/=lib/absmate/
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Create a game contract

Create a contract that requests and receives random numbers by extending `VRNGConsumer`.

```solidity title="src/CoinFlipGame.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import {VRNGConsumer} from "absmate/src/utils/vrng/VRNGConsumer.sol";

contract CoinFlipGame is VRNGConsumer {
    mapping(uint256 => address) public games;

    constructor(address vrngSystem) {
        _setVRNG(vrngSystem); // Initialize vRNG system
    }

    // 1 - Request a random number from vRNG service
    function playGame() external returns (uint256 requestId) {
        // Request randomness from vRNG service
        requestId = _requestRandomNumber();

        games[requestId] = msg.sender;
        return requestId;
    }

    // 2 - Receive a random number from vRNG service in this callback
    function _onRandomNumberFulfilled(
        uint256 requestId,
        uint256 randomNumber
    ) internal override {
        // Use random number to determine some game outcome logic.
        bool playerWon = (randomNumber % 2) == 0;
    }
}
```

## 3. Test with mock contracts

Test your game contract behaviour with Absmate's mock contracts.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a test contract">

    Use the `MockVRNGSystem` contract to mock the VRNG system in your tests. 
    
    Pass its contract address to your game contract, by providing it to the `_setVRNG` function _(here we do it via a constructor argument to the `CoinFlipGame` contract)_.

    ```solidity title="test/CoinFlipGameTest.t.sol"
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

    import {Test} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
    import {MockVRNGSystem} from "absmate/test/mocks/MockVRNGSystem.sol";
    import {CoinFlipGame} from "../src/CoinFlipGame.sol";

    contract CoinFlipGameTest is Test {
        MockVRNGSystem mockVRNG;
        CoinFlipGame game;

        function setUp() public {
            mockVRNG = new MockVRNGSystem(); // deploy mockVRNG
            game = new CoinFlipGame(address(mockVRNG)); // call _setVRNG with mockVRNG address
        }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your contract with request/fulfill pattern mocks">

    Mock the two-phase request/fulfill pattern:

    1. Request a random number from the vRNG service.
    2. Mock the callback function execution using `randomNumberCallback`.

    ```solidity title="test/CoinFlipGameTest.t.sol"
    function testCoinFlip() public {
        address player = address(0x123);
        
        // Request randomness from vRNG service
        vm.prank(player);
        uint256 requestId = game.playGame();

        // Simulate vRNG callback with controlled value
        vm.prank(address(mockVRNG));
        uint256 randomNumber = 2; // control the random number delivered
        game.randomNumberCallback(requestId, randomNumber);
        
        // Verify some behaviour based on the random number delivered
        assertEq(game.games(requestId), player);
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your tests">

    Verify your contract behaves as expected.
    See [Foundry testing](/build-on-abstract/smart-contracts/foundry/testing-contracts) for more details.

    ```bash
    forge test --zksync
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Deploy your contract

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a deploy script">

  Create a deploy script to deploy your game contract with the [Proof of Play vRNG contract address](https://docs.proofofplay.com/services/vrng/about#supported-networks) based on the chain ID.

  ```solidity title="script/DeployCoinFlipGame.s.sol"
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

  import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
  import {CoinFlipGame} from "../src/CoinFlipGame.sol";

  contract DeployCoinFlipGame is Script {
      function run() external {
          uint256 chainId = block.chainid;
          address vrngSystemAddress = _getProofOfPlayVRNGAddress(chainId);
          require(vrngSystemAddress != address(0), "Unsupported chain");

          vm.startBroadcast();
          CoinFlipGame coinFlipGame = new CoinFlipGame(vrngSystemAddress);
          vm.stopBroadcast();
      }

      function _getProofOfPlayVRNGAddress(
          uint256 chainId
      ) internal pure returns (address) {
          return
              chainId == 2741 // Abstract Mainnet
                  ? 0xBDC8B6eb1840215A22fC1134046f595b7D42C2DE
                  : chainId == 11124 // Abstract Testnet
                      ? 0xC04ae87CDd258994614f7fFB8506e69B7Fd8CF1D
                      : address(0);
      }
  }
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the deploy script">

  Deploy your contract to Abstract using the deploy script.

  ```bash
  forge script script/DeployCoinFlipGame.s.sol:DeployCoinFlipGame \
    --account myKeystore \
    --rpc-url https://api.testnet.abs.xyz \
    --chain 11124 \
    --zksync \
    --broadcast \
    --verify \
    --verifier etherscan \
    --verifier-url https://api-sepolia.abscan.org/api \
    --etherscan-api-key TACK2D1RGYX9U7MC31SZWWQ7FCWRYQ96AD
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Contact the Proof of Play team">

  The Proof of Play vRNG contracts currently require your contract address to be whitelisted to enable the `randomNumberCallback` function to be called.

  [Contact the Proof of Play team](https://z7a9jnrajv8.typeform.com/to/Ywh9xVFF?utm_source=abstract-docs&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=vrng-integration) to whitelist your smart contract address.
