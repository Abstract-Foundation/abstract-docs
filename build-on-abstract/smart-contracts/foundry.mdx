To use Foundry to build smart contracts on Abstract, use the [foundry-zksync](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync) fork.

</Card>

## 1. Install the foundry-zksync fork

<Note>
  This installation overrides any existing forge and cast binaries in
  `~/.foundry`. To revert to the standard foundry installation, follow the
  [Foundry installation
  guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation#using-foundryup).
  You can swap between the two installations at any time.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install foundry-zksync">

Install the `foundryup-zksync` fork:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/main/install-foundry-zksync | bash
```

Run `foundryup-zksync` to install `forge`, `cast`, and `anvil`:

```bash
foundryup-zksync
```

You may need to restart your terminal session after installation to continue.

  <Accordion title="Common installation issues" icon="circle-exclamation">
    <AccordionGroup>
        <Accordion title="foundryup-zksync: command not found">
          Restart your terminal session.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Could not detect shell">
        To add the `foundry` binary to your PATH, run the following command:
        ```
        export PATH="$PATH:/Users/<your-username-here>/.foundry/bin"
        ```
        Replace `<your-username-here>` with the correct path to your home directory.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Library not loaded: libusb" >
        The [libusb](https://libusb.info/) library may need to be installed manually on MacOS.
        Run the following command to install the library:
        ```bash
        brew install libusb
        ```
        </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify installation">

    A helpful command to check if the installation was successful is:

    ```bash
    forge build --help | grep -A 20 "ZKSync configuration:"
    ```

    If installed successfully, 20 lines of `--zksync` options will be displayed.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Create a new project

Create a new project with `forge` and change directory into the project.

```bash
forge init my-abstract-project && cd my-abstract-project
```

## 3. Modify Foundry configuration

Update your `foundry.toml` file to include the following options:

```toml
[profile.default]
src = 'src'
libs = ['lib']
fallback_oz = true
is_system = false # Note: NonceHolder and the ContractDeployer system contracts can only be called with a special isSystem flag as true
mode = "3"
```

<Note>
To use [system contracts](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/overview),
set the `is_system` flag to **true**.

</Note>

## 4. Write a smart contract

Modify the `src/Counter.sol` file to include the following smart contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public number;

    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
        number = newNumber;
    }

    function increment() public {
        number++;
    }
}
```

## 5. Compile the smart contract

Use the [zksolc compiler](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/components/compiler/toolchain/solidity)
(installed in the above steps) to compile smart contracts for Abstract:

```bash
forge build --zksync
```

You should now see the compiled smart contracts in the generated `zkout` directory.

## 6. Deploy the smart contract

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get testnet funds" icon="wallet">
    Deploying smart contracts requires testnet ETH.

    Claim testnet funds via a [faucet](/tooling/faucets), or
    [bridge](/tooling/bridges) ETH from Sepolia to the Abstract testnet.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your private key" icon="key">
    Create a new [wallet keystore](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-wallet-import).

    ```bash
    cast wallet import myKeystore --interactive
    ```

    Enter your wallet&rsquo;s private key when prompted & provide a password to encrypt it.

    <Warning>We recommend not to use a private key associated with real funds. Create a new wallet for this step.</Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy your smart contract" icon="rocket">

Run the following command to deploy your smart contracts:

```bash
forge create src/Counter.sol:Counter \
    --account myKeystore \
    --rpc-url https://api.testnet.abs.xyz \
    --chain 11124 \
    --zksync
```

Ensure `myKeystore` is the name of the keystore file you created in the previous step.

If successful, the output should look similar to the following:

```bash
Deployer: 0x9C073184e74Af6D10DF575e724DC4712D98976aC
Deployed to: 0x85717893A18F255285AB48d7bE245ddcD047dEAE
Transaction hash: 0x2a4c7c32f26b078d080836b247db3e6c7d0216458a834cfb8362a2ac84e68d9f
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify your smart contract on the block explorer" icon="check">

Verifying your smart contract is helpful for others to view the code and
interact with it from a [block explorer](/tooling/block-explorers).
To verify your smart contract, run the following command:

```bash
forge verify-contract 0x85717893A18F255285AB48d7bE245ddcD047dEAE \
    src/Counter.sol:Counter \
    --verifier etherscan \
    --verifier-url https://api-sepolia.abscan.org/api \
    --etherscan-api-key TACK2D1RGYX9U7MC31SZWWQ7FCWRYQ96AD \
    --zksync
```

_**Note**: Replace the contract path and address with your own._
