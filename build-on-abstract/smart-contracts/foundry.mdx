To use Foundry to build smart contracts on Abstract, use the [foundry-zksync](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync) fork.

</Card>

## 1. Install the foundry-zksync fork

<Note>
  This installation overrides any existing forge and cast binaries in
  `~/.foundry`. To revert to the standard foundry installation, follow the
  [Foundry installation
  guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation#using-foundryup).
  You can swap between the two installations at any time.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Script">
  In '~' directory, run the following line from the [Foundry-zksync book](https://foundry-book.zksync.io/getting-started/installation).

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/main/install-foundry-zksync | bash
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the installer">
  Change directory into the `foundry-zksync` directory.

  <Accordion title="Common installation issues" icon="circle-exclamation">
    
    <AccordionGroup>
        <Accordion title="Could not detect shell">
        To add the `foundry` binary to your PATH, run the following command:

        ```
        export PATH="$PATH:/Users/<your-username-here>/.foundry/bin"
        ```

        Replace `<your-username-here>` with the correct path to your home directory.

        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Library not loaded: libusb" >
         The [libusb](https://libusb.info/) library may need to be installed manually on MacOS.

         Run the following command to install the library:

         ```bash
         brew install libusb
        ```
        </Accordion>

    </AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>

A successful installation will output the following message:

```bash
Forge version 0.0.2 is successfully installed.
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify installation">

    A helpful command to check if the installation was successful is:

    ```bash
    forge build --help | grep -A 20 "ZKSync configuration:"
    ```

    If successful, it will output `20` lines of the available
    options included in the `foundry-zksync` fork.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Create a new project

First, change directory _out_ of the `foundry-zksync` directory.

```bash
cd ..
```

Create a new project with Forge and change directory into the project.

```bash
forge init my-abstract-project && cd my-abstract-project
```

## 3. Modify Foundry configuration

Update your `forge.toml` file to include the following options:

```toml
[profile.default]
src = 'src'
libs = ['lib']
fallback_oz = true
is_system = false # Note: NonceHolder and the ContractDeployer system contracts can only be called with a special isSystem flag as true
mode = "3"
```

<Note>
To use [system contracts](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/overview),
set the `is_system` flag to **true**.

</Note>

## 4. Write a smart contract

Modify the `src/Counter.sol` file to include the following smart contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public number;

    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
        number = newNumber;
    }

    function increment() public {
        number++;
    }
}
```

## 5. Compile the smart contract

Use the [zksolc compiler](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/components/compiler/toolchain/solidity)
(installed in the above steps) to compile smart contracts for Abstract:

```bash
forge build --zksync
```

You should now see the compiled smart contracts in the generated `zkout` directory.

## 6. Deploy the smart contract

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get testnet funds" icon="wallet">
    Deploying smart contracts requires testnet ETH.

    Claim testnet funds via a [faucet](/ecosystem/faucets), or
    [bridge](/ecosystem/bridges) ETH from Sepolia to the Abstract testnet.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your private key" icon="key">
    Create a new [wallet keystore](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-wallet-import).

    ```bash
    cast wallet import myKeystore --interactive
    ```

    Enter your wallet&rsquo;s private key when prompted & provide a password to encrypt it.

    <Warning>We recommend not to use a private key associated with real funds. Create a new wallet for this step.</Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy your smart contract" icon="rocket">

Run the following command to deploy your smart contracts:

```bash
forge create src/Counter.sol:Counter --account myKeystore --rpc-url https://api.testnet.abs.xyz --chain 11124 --zksync
```

Ensure `myKeystore` _(in the above command)_ is the name of the keystore file you created in the previous step.

If successful, your output should look similar to the following:

```bash
Deployer: 0x8e729E23CDc8bC21c37a73DA4bA9ebdddA3C8B6d
Deployed to: 0x1590522E5758a7A8DD00f212fe487AE94fE69dcf
Transaction hash: 0xa7e2ecf1611fc01221678ac2c8919fe9c338b2aad9ac1ff4ae6f0d1711a62cf0
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify smart contract on the block explorer" icon="check">
  Contract verification is not supported with Foundry yet.

You can verify your smart contracts manually on the [Abstract block explorer](https://explorer.testnet.abs.xyz/contracts/verify).
