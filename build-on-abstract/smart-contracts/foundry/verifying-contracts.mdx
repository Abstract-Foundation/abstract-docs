## Verifying Contracts

Contracts can be verified as they are deployed as described in [Deploying Contracts](/build-on-abstract/smart-contracts/foundry/deploying-contracts). This page outlines how to verify contracts that have already been deployed on Abstract.

<Steps>

<Step title="Get an Abscan API key">

Follow the [Abscan documentation](https://docs.abscan.org/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics) to get an API key.

</Step>

<Step title="Verify an existing contract">

Verify an existing contract by running the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Testnet
forge verify-contract 0x85717893A18F255285AB48d7bE245ddcD047dEAE \
    src/Counter.sol:Counter \
    --chain abstract-testnet
    --etherscan-api-key <your-etherscan-api-key-here> \
    --zksync
```

```bash Mainnet
forge verify-contract 0x85717893A18F255285AB48d7bE245ddcD047dEAE \
    src/Counter.sol:Counter \
    --chain abstract \
    --etherscan-api-key <your-etherscan-api-key-here> \
    --zksync
```

</CodeGroup>

_**Note**: Replace the contract path, address, and API key with your own._
