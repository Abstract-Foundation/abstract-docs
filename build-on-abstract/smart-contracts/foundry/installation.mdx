Get started with Foundry-zksync by following the steps below.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install foundry-zksync">

Install the `foundryup-zksync` fork:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/main/install-foundry-zksync | bash
```

Run `foundryup-zksync` to install `forge`, `cast`, and `anvil`:

```

You may need to restart your terminal session after installation to continue.
