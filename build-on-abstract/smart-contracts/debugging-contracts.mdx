To view logs, trace calls to [system contracts](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/overview) and more, 
Abstract offers a [local node](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-test-node).

## Running a local node

To get started running a local node, follow the steps below:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Prerequisites">
    If you are on Windows, we strongly recommend using [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

    The node is written in Rust. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your machine:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone the repository">
  From any directory, clone the `era-test-node` repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matter-labs/era-test-node && cd era-test-node
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Build smart contracts">
  You will notice there is a [Makefile](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-test-node/blob/main/Makefile)
  at the root of the repository containing various commands.

Use the commands below to fetch and build the smart contracts:

```bash
make fetch-contracts && make build-contracts
```

You can now make any changes (such as including logs) to the smart contracts in the `contracts` directory.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Build the node">
  To build the binary, run the following command. 
  
  *Omit `clean` and `build-contracts` 
  if you have not made any changes to the smart contracts.*

```bash
make clean && make build-contracts && make rust-build
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the node">
    Once built, the node binary is available at `./target/release/era-test-node`.

    Run the node using the built binary:

```bash
./target/release/era_test_node
```

    You can also run the node that forks from the current state of the Abstract testnet:

```bash
./target/release/era_test_node fork https://api.testnet.abs.xyz
```

  </Step>

</Steps>

### Network Details

Use the details below to connect to the local node:

- **Chain ID**: `260`
- **RPC URL**: `http://localhost:8011`
- `ethNetwork`: `localhost` (Add this for [Hardhat](/build-on-abstract/smart-contracts/hardhat))
- `zksync`: `true` (Add this for [Hardhat](/build-on-abstract/smart-contracts/hardhat))
