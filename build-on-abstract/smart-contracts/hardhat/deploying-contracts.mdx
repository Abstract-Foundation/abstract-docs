## Deploying Contract

<Steps>

  <Step title="Install zksync-ethers">

    The [zksync-ethers](https://sdk.zksync.io/js/ethers/why-zksync-ethers) package provides a modified version of the ethers library that is compatible with Abstract and the ZKsync VM. Install the package by running the following command:

  <CodeGroup>
  
    ```bash npm
    npm install -D zksync-ethers
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn add -D zksync-ethers
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add -D zksync-ethers
    ```

    ```bash bun
    bun add -D zksync-ethers
    ```

  </CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the deployer account private key">
    Create a new [configuration variable](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/configuration-variables)
    called `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`.

    ```bash
    npx hardhat vars set DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY
    ```

    Enter the private key of a new wallet you created for this step.

    ```bash
    ✔ Enter value: · ****************************************************************
    ```

    <Warning>Do NOT use a private key associated with real funds. Create a new wallet for this step.</Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Get ETH in the deployer account">
    The deployer account requires ETH to deploy a smart contract.

    - **Testnet**: Claim ETH via a [faucet](/tooling/faucets), or
    [bridge](/tooling/bridges) ETH from Sepolia.
    - **Mainnet**: Use a [bridge](/tooling/bridges) to transfer ETH to Abstract mainnet.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Write the deployment script">
    Create a new [Hardhat script](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/advanced/scripts) located at `/deploy/deploy.ts`:

    ```bash
    mkdir deploy && touch deploy/deploy.ts
    ```

    Add the following code to the `deploy.ts` file:

    ```typescript
    import { Wallet } from "zksync-ethers";
    import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";
    import { Deployer } from "@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync";
    import { vars } from "hardhat/config";

    // An example of a deploy script that will deploy and call a simple contract.
    export default async function (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) {
      console.log(`Running deploy script`);

      // Initialize the wallet using your private key.
      const wallet = new Wallet(vars.get("DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY"));

      // Create deployer object and load the artifact of the contract we want to deploy.
      const deployer = new Deployer(hre, wallet);
      // Load contract
      const artifact = await deployer.loadArtifact("HelloAbstract");

      // Deploy this contract. The returned object will be of a `Contract` type,
      // similar to the ones in `ethers`.
      const tokenContract = await deployer.deploy(artifact);

      console.log(
        `${
          artifact.contractName
        } was deployed to ${await tokenContract.getAddress()}`
      );
    }
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy your smart contract">

Run the following command to deploy your smart contracts:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Testnet
npx hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy.ts --network abstractTestnet
```

```bash Mainnet
npx hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy.ts --network abstractMainnet
```

</CodeGroup>

If successful, your output should look similar to the following:

```bash {2}
Running deploy script
HelloAbstract was deployed to YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Providing constructor arguments

The second argument to the `deploy` function is an array of constructor arguments.

To deploy your smart contract with constructor arguments, provide an array containing your constructor arguments as the second argument to the `deploy` function.

```typescript [expandable] {12-15}
import { Wallet } from "zksync-ethers";
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";
import { Deployer } from "@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync";
import { vars } from "hardhat/config";

// An example of a deploy script that will deploy and call a simple contract.
export default async function (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) {
  const wallet = new Wallet(vars.get("DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY"));
  const deployer = new Deployer(hre, wallet);
  const artifact = await deployer.loadArtifact("HelloAbstract");

  // Provide the constructor arguments
  const constructorArgs = ["Hello, Abstract!"];
  const tokenContract = await deployer.deploy(artifact, constructorArgs);

  console.log(
    `${
      artifact.contractName
    } was deployed to ${await tokenContract.getAddress()}`
  );
}
```

## Create2 & Smart Wallet Deployments

Specify different deployment types by using the third `deploymentType` parameter:

- **create**: Standard contract deployment (default)
- **create2**: Deterministic deployment using CREATE2
- **createAccount**: Deploy a [smart contract wallet](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/smart-contract-wallets).
- **create2Account**: Deterministic deployment of a [smart contract wallet](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/smart-contract-wallets).

```typescript [expandable] {11}
import { Wallet } from "zksync-ethers";
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";
import { Deployer } from "@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync";
import { vars } from "hardhat/config";

export default async function (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) {
  const wallet = new Wallet(vars.get("DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY"));
  const deployer = new Deployer(hre, wallet);
  const artifact = await deployer.loadArtifact("HelloAbstract");

  const deploymentType = "create2";
  const tokenContract = await deployer.deploy(artifact, [], deploymentType);

  console.log(
    `${
      artifact.contractName
    } was deployed to ${await tokenContract.getAddress()}`
  );
}
```

## Additional Factory Dependencies

Factory smart contracts (contracts that can deploy other contracts) require the bytecode of the contracts they can deploy
to be provided within the factory dependencies array.

[Learn more about factory dependencies](/how-abstract-works/evm-differences/contract-deployment).

```typescript [expandable] {5-6,16}
import { Wallet } from "zksync-ethers";
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";
import { Deployer } from "@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync";

// Additional bytecode dependencies (typically imported from artifacts)
const contractBytecode = "0x..."; // Your contract bytecode

const wallet = new Wallet(vars.get("DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY"));
const deployer = new Deployer(hre, wallet);
const artifact = await deployer.loadArtifact("FactoryContract");
const contract = await deployer.deploy(
  artifact,
  ["Hello world!"],
  "create",
  {},
  [contractBytecode]
);
```
