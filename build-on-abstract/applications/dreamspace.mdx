Dreamspace is a drag and drop vibe coding studio where anyone can build data-driven onchain applications and deploy their smaart contracts to any EVM-compatible chain including Abstract.

## 1. Create a new project

Go to the [Dreamspace](https://dreamspace.xyz) wesite and click “Start Creating.”
You can either:

- Start with a blank project, or

- Enter an app description and let Dreamspace generate a starter app for you.

Once created, your project will open in the AI-powered canvas editor.

## 2. Edit your app with AI

Click on any component in the canvas (it will be highlighted in pink).
Type an edit request into the chatbot, such as:

- change the background to blue

Dreamspace will automatically apply your changes. You can also undo/redo, resize, and move components directly in the canvas.

## 3. Style your app

Use the Themes tab in the chatbot to customize fonts, colors, and layouts.

This makes it easy to brand your dApp without writing CSS.

## 4. Add blockchain data & contracts

Use Prompt-to-SQL to query onchain data and build charts or analytics dashboards in the AI-powered data studio.

Generate your smart contract by simply asking the AI chatbot to. (Dreamspace supports contract deployment across EVM chains, including Abstract, Ethereum, and Polygon.)

Coonect to third-party APIs.


## 5. Deploy your app

Once your app is ready, click “Publish” in the Dreamspace editor.

Select your preferred blockchain (e.g., Abstract) and Dreamspace will handle contract deployment and hosting automatically.
