Abstract is EVM compatible, however, there are [differences](/how-abstract-works/evm-differences/overview)
between Abstract and Ethereum that enable more powerful user experiences. For developers, additional configuration may be required
to accommodate these changes and take full advantage of Abstract's capabilities.

Follow the guides below to learn how to best set up your environment for Abstract.

## Smart Contracts

Learn how to create a new smart contract project, compile your contracts, and deploy them to Abstract.
Currently, it is recommended to use [Hardhat](/build-on-abstract/smart-contracts/hardhat), as the Foundry fork is
in the alpha stage and has [limited support](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync?tab=readme-ov-file#limitations).
