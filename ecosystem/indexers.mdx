[Ghost](https://GhostGraph.xyz/) makes it easy to build blazingly fast indexers (subgraphs) for smart contracts.

Ghost is the first indexing solution that lets you write your index transformations in **Solidity**. Abstract dApps can query data with GraphQL using our hosted endpoints.

To get started, you can [sign up for an account](https://app.ghostlogs.xyz/ghostgraph/sign-up) and follow [this quickstart](https://docs.ghostlogs.xyz/category/-getting-started-1) guide on how to create, deploy, and query a GhostGraph.
