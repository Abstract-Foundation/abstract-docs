## The Graph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an indexing protocol that provides an easy way to query blockchain data through decentralized APIs known as subgraphs. 

With The Graph, developers can benefit from:
 - Decentralized Indexing: Enables indexing blockchain data through multiple indexers, thus eliminating any single point of failure
 - GraphQL Queries: Provides a powerful GraphQL interface for querying indexed data, making data retrieval super simple.
 - Customization: Define your own logic for transforming & storing blockchain data. Reuse subgraphs published by other developers on The Graph Network.

Follow this [quick-start](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/quick-start/) guide to create, deploy, and query a subgraph within 5 minutes.
