## Streaming Guidelines

Our mission is to create a space where high-quality streams and hardworking creators shine. We champion creators who show up, put in the effort, and genuinely care about entertaining their audiences and the Abstract ecosystem. By setting clear standards and offering real support, we help creators grow their skills, build meaningful communities, and bring their best for each stream.

### Core Expectations

Creators representing or streaming within this ecosystem must follow three pillars:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Be Present" icon="user">
    Your stream must involve active participation, presence, and engagement.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Original" icon="lightbulb">
    Your content must respect copyrights and avoid DMCA-risky material.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Relevant" icon="bullseye">
    Your stream should provide value to the ecosystem, community, product, games, or culture.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Content Relevance Requirements

#### No AFK / Idle Streaming

We do **NOT** allow:
- Sleeping streams
- Abandoned streams
- Looped or replayed content portrayed as live
- "Set it and forget it" passive farming
- Streams where the creator is absent for extended periods

**Why:** AFK streams damage trust, dilute engagement quality, and create an unfair environment for active creators.

**Enforcement:** Immediate warning → stream removal → potential suspension from creator program.

#### No Copyrighted TV/Movies/Anime/Sports/YouTube Clips

As a creator in this ecosystem, you must **never stream:**
- TV shows
- Movies
- Anime episodes
- PPV content
- Sports broadcasts
- Copyrighted YouTube/Twitch clips
- Reaction streams that re-upload large portions of copyrighted content

Even if "everyone else does it," we do not. This is **strict zero tolerance** to protect our platform, our creators, our partners, and our long-term reputation.

**Enforcement:** Immediate takedown → potential ban from the creator program → repeat offenses result in permanent removal.
